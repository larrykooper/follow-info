follow-info 

A Twitter web application

I wrote follow-info provide a few functions that Twitter natively doesn't provide.  

It does these things: 

- Update a database of the people I follow and how many followers each one of them has.

- Update a database of the people who follow me.

- Track changes in both of those lists since the last update.  This allows me to see who unfollows me and who might have changed their username. 

- Calculate statistics including average number of followers among those I follow and how many of those I follow have more or fewer followers than I. 

- Display all the above and allow the lists to be sorted by name or number of followers. 

Also, there's an option to manually enter a new person I follow from the homepage of the app, to avoid redoing the whole list to add one user. 

Because the updating of the lists can take a long time, I chose to use the backgroundrb library to offload the long-running processing. 
While the lists are being updated in the background, I poll the background worker every 3 seconds using periodically_call_remote, and update a progress bar.  

I parse the response from Twitter into JSON to make it easier to deal with.

To use the background functions of the app, before starting the server, start backgroundrb using ./script/backgroundrb at the Rails root. 

Because this has been up to now a single-user app, you will need to make a few code changes to make it run for any user (Sorry, no setup app yet):

app/models/setup.rb - fill in your Twitter username and password (4 times)
app/models/larry.rb - fill in your Twitter username (2 times)
lib/twitcon.rb - fill in your Twitter username (2 times)
