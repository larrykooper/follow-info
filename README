follow-info

A Twitter web application

I wrote follow-info provide a few functions that Twitter natively doesn't provide.

It does these things:

- Update a database of the people I follow and how many followers each one of them has.

- Update a database of the people who follow me.

- Track changes in both of those lists since the last update.  This allows me to see who unfollows me and who might have changed their username.

- Calculate statistics including average number of followers among those I follow and how many of those I follow have more or fewer followers than I.

- Display all the above and allow the lists to be sorted by name or number of followers.

Also, there's an option to manually enter a new person I follow from the homepage of the app, to avoid redoing the whole list to add one user.

Because the updating of the lists can take a long time, I chose to use Resque to offload the long-running processing.
While the lists are being updated in the background, I poll the background worker every 3 seconds, and update a progress bar.

I parse the response from Twitter into JSON to make it easier to deal with.

Because this has been up to now a single-user app, you will need to make a few code changes to make it run for any user (Sorry, no setup app yet):

replace YourTwitterUsername with

app/models/larrys_twitter_account.rb - replace YourTwitterUsername with your Twitter username (2 times)
app/workers/update_lists_job.rb - replace YourTwitterUsername with your Twitter username (1 time)
lib/tasks/follow.rake - replace YourTwitterUsername with your Twitter username (1 time)
lib/twitter.rb -replace YourTwitterUsername with your Twitter username (2 times)
